Employee App 

Checks if the employee is in the database of the 3 employees shown. The facescan checks if the employee is matching any of the employees shown in the database. The one with the highest score or at the very top of the list is the employee that matches the closest to the employees shown in the database. Once the photo is taken the coordinates are shown in the "Current Location" and you can also get a map view of your current location. In order to use current location you must press the button on the top right which will direct you to your current location.
